The Noether Framework
=====================

The Noether Framework is an open software framework for Engineering AI, introducing repeatable, extensible, and production-oriented workflows. Built on transformer building blocks, it delivers the full engineering stack, allowing teams to build, train, and apply industrial models across engineering verticals, eliminating the need for component re-engineering and an in-house deep learning team.

Get started by exploring the core components and principles of the framework:

* :doc:`introduction_to_noether_framework`
  An overview of the framework's architecture, its submodules (core, data, modeling, etc.), and how they interact in typical workflows.

* :doc:`design_principles_and_limitations`
  The fundamental pillars of Noether, such as configuration-driven development, the factory pattern, and type safety, as well as its architectural boundaries.

* :doc:`key_concepts`
  A guide to the flexible workflows offered by Noether, explaining when to use configuration-driven versus code-driven approaches.

* :doc:`model_zoo`
  A collection of pre-built model architectures for various engineering tasks, ready to be used or extended

* :doc:`dataset_zoo`
  A library of dataset classes and utilities for loading, processing, and validating data from various sources
